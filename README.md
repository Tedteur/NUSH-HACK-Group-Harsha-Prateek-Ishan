# NUSH-HACK-Group-Harsha-Prateek-Ishan
NUSH Hackathon 2021 group code (Harsha, Prateek and Ishan)
# Instructions (for the main code - remote desktop protocol): host launches app and sets up password. User launches the app and runs Main.main(). User inputs ip address and enters password
# Instructions (for the java fx): To run the desktop with java fx, install intelliJ (which is a java ID). Then, directly open the whole Hackathon_2021 folder using intelliJ. Then, download javafx. Install the files in a place your remember, and then place all the files in "lib" (which is in the java fx sdk file) except the zip into the project structure in intelliJ and then under libraries. Then, run the HelloApplication.java file.
